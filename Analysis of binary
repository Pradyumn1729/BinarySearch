note that in a binary search algorithm ,we can see that the height of the tree represents 
the maximum number of iterations required to search the key in the array 

also,we need to note that logn with base 2 represents the height of tree ,where n is the number of elements 
in the array 

if we have 16 elements in the array then the iterartions would be log base 2 of 16 ,that is 4
